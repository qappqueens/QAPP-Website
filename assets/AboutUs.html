    The Queen's Application Development Society, also referred to as “QAPP”, is Queen's University’s premier
    application development club. Our members intend to create practical applications throughout the school-year
    in the hopes of advancing their development portfolio’s, while also attaining real-world experience as a
    developer. With a dedicated development team, and a creative marketing team, we believe that our apps can reach
    the hands of many.
